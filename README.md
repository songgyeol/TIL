Thank you for submitting CollaboGame for review. During our review, we noticed a few things that you'll need to address before your app can be approved for the App Store.

Understand the Review
To find out why your app wasn't approved, go to Resolution Center in iTunes Connect. Keep in mind that there may be more than one reason why your app was rejected. It's also possible that we need more information about your app.

If you have a question about your app's review, send us a message in Resolution Center. If you would prefer to speak over the phone, just let us know in your message, and we'll schedule a call.

Visit Resolution Center >

Address the Issue
After you understand the review, you'll need to make the necessary changes to fix the issue. If you need help making these changes, you can get advice from fellow developers and Apple experts in the Developer Forums. If you have a technical question that can't be answered in the Developer Forums, you can request code-level technical support by visiting the Code-Level Support page in your account on the Apple Developer website.

Resubmit Your App
Sometimes, we just need some additional information about your app, or your app's metadata needs to be edited. If this is the case, you don't need to resubmit your app. Simply make the changes and send us a message in Resolution Center when you're done.

If other changes need to be made, you'll need to resubmit. After you do, we'll typically respond within 48 hours, unless your app requires extra attention.

After we've completed the review, we'll update your app's status and let you know.

Best regards,

App Store Review
